            Asheville is 30 minutes from Mojo Manor, which means it's an easy day trip on any morning you wake up and want something more urban. Asheville has been on everyone's radar for a while now and it's earned the attention. The food scene is genuinely excellent, the River Arts District is one of the better working artist communities in the Southeast, and the Biltmore Estate is actually worth the admission price. Here's how to spend a day in Asheville without wasting half of it on logistics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-post-body">

          <h2>Getting There and Parking</h2>

          <p>Asheville is 30 minutes east on I-40. Take the Merrimon Avenue or Tunnel Road exits for the north and east sides of town, or the Haywood Road exit for West Asheville. Downtown parking can be tricky on weekends, but the city has a number of parking decks that are free for the first hour or two. The Rankin Avenue garage and the Wall Street deck are both well-located for downtown and the Pack Square area. If you're going to the River Arts District, you'll find on-street parking along Riverside Drive and Depot Street.</p>

          <p>Heads up: Asheville on a Saturday in October is a different experience than Asheville on a Tuesday in March. If you're visiting during fall foliage season or a summer weekend, plan for traffic and consider going early. The city doesn't really slow down until well after 10am.</p>

          <h2>Morning: River Arts District</h2>

          <p>The River Arts District, or RAD as locals call it, sits along the French Broad River on the west side of downtown. It's a former industrial district that has been converting old warehouses and rail facilities into artists' studios, galleries, restaurants, and breweries over the past couple of decades. The transformation is still happening, which gives it an energy that's different from the more polished parts of downtown.</p>

          <p>The best way to see it is on foot. Park somewhere along Depot Street or Riverside Drive and just walk. Most of the studios are open to visitors during weekend hours, and you'll find working ceramicists, painters, woodworkers, and sculptors actually making things. It doesn't feel like a mall with art in it. It feels like a place where people are genuinely working. That's the part that's worth your time.</p>

          <p>A few names worth knowing: the Phil Mechanic Building at 109 Roberts Street has several floors of studios. The Wedge Brewing Company has been anchoring the RAD for years and is a reliable stop for a morning coffee (they have it) or an afternoon pint. Nearby, the New Belgium Brewing taproom opened in 2016 and has a massive outdoor deck along the river that's worth visiting regardless of whether you're a craft beer person.</p>

          <h2>Midday: Downtown and Pack Square</h2>

          <p>Walk or drive the short distance from the RAD into downtown proper. Asheville's downtown is small enough to cover on foot, with most of the interesting blocks concentrated around Pack Square, Lexington Avenue, and the Haywood Street corridor.</p>

          <p>For lunch, the options are genuinely good. Biscuit Head is the place if you want a proper Southern breakfast extended into midday, with housemade biscuits and an extensive gravy bar that sounds weird and is delicious. Curate is one of the best Spanish restaurants in the region, though it's more of a dinner spot. For a casual midday option, Gan Shan Station does excellent pan-Asian street food in a cozy space on Charlotte Street just above downtown.</p>

          <p>The Lexington Avenue corridor is worth a slow walk. The blocks between downtown and the River Arts District have a good density of independent bookstores, vintage shops, record stores, and small restaurants. Malaprop's Bookstore is an Asheville institution with a well-curated selection and an attached cafe. If you're traveling with a reader, budget some time here.</p>

          <h2>Afternoon: Biltmore Estate</h2>

          <p>Biltmore is the largest privately-owned house in the United States, built by George Vanderbilt in the 1890s and still owned by his descendants. The estate covers about 8,000 acres and the house itself has 250 rooms. It's genuinely impressive, not in a theme park way, but in the way that shows you what absurd wealth looked like before the income tax existed.</p>

          <p>Admission runs around $65-75 per adult depending on the season, which sounds steep until you're inside and realize you could easily spend four hours there. The house tour covers the main floors including the banquet hall (which seats 64), the indoor swimming pool, the bowling alley, and more rooms than you can mentally keep track of. The gardens were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the same guy who designed Central Park, and they're beautiful in every season.</p>

          <p>A few practical notes: book tickets online in advance, especially in fall when they run out. There's also a winery on the property that does free tastings with admission. The food at the estate restaurants is overpriced and average, so eat before you go or after you leave. Parking is free and the estate runs shuttles from the lot to the main house.</p>

          <p>If Biltmore is already on your list from a previous Asheville trip, the North Carolina Arboretum is a strong alternative. It sits on 434 acres at the southern end of Asheville with good trail systems, a national quilting collection in the visitor center, and genuinely spectacular gardens. Less famous than Biltmore, worth your time.</p>

          <h2>Late Afternoon: Craft Beer and the Return Drive</h2>

          <p>Asheville has more craft breweries per capita than just about any city in the country, and the quality is consistently high. A few worth knowing: Wicked Weed Brewing on Biltmore Avenue is one of the originals and still one of the best, known particularly for sour and farmhouse ales. Hi-Wire Brewing has a large taproom in the South Slope neighborhood that's good for groups. Catawba Brewing, originally from Morganton, has a large Asheville location in the South Slope as well.</p>

          <p>If craft beer isn't your thing, the cocktail scene is solid too. The Imperial Life on the South Slope does serious cocktails in a good atmosphere. Sovereign Remedies downtown has a focus on herbal and botanical cocktails that sounds gimmicky and is actually very good.</p>

          <p>The drive back to Waynesville on I-40 west takes about 30 minutes, which means you can have a civilized dinner in Asheville and be back at Mojo Manor by 9pm without any stress. Or you can head back earlier and make dinner in Waynesville. Either way works. The point is you're not making a sacrifice by staying in Waynesville when Asheville is this close.</p>

            <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.8);line-height:1.75;margin:0 0 1.5rem;">Stay in the mountains, play in the city. Mojo Manor is 30 minutes from Asheville, 5 minutes from downtown Waynesville, and right at the edge of the Blue Ridge Parkway. It's a better base than being in Asheville itself.</p>

          <h2>If You Only Have a Few Hours</h2>

          <p>If your Asheville time is limited, skip trying to see everything and do one thing well. Our pick for a half-day trip: spend two hours walking the River Arts District, grab lunch at one of the RAD restaurants, then drive up to the Overlook at the end of Charlotte Street for a view of the city and the surrounding mountains before heading back. That's a satisfying four-hour slice of what Asheville actually is, without spending the whole day in the car or waiting in lines.</p>

          <h2>A Few Things People Get Wrong About Asheville</h2>

          <p>Asheville is frequently described as this transformative experience, and sometimes that expectation sets people up for disappointment. It's a mid-sized mountain city with genuinely great food, good arts, and solid craft beer. The architecture is interesting, especially the Art Deco buildings downtown. But it's not magic. Go with reasonable expectations and you'll leave happy. Go expecting your life to change and you might come back to Waynesville a little underwhelmed.</p>

          <p>Also, parking on a Saturday evening downtown is a real challenge. If you're planning a dinner reservation in Asheville, either use the parking decks early and walk to your restaurant, or use a rideshare from wherever you park further out. The city is compact enough that this works fine.</p>
