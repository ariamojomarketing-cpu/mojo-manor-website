            Western North Carolina has become one of the better craft beer regions in the country, and staying in Waynesville puts you in the middle of it. You've got Panacea Brewing five minutes away in downtown Waynesville, Boojum Brewing a short drive into Waynesville proper, BearWaters in Canton just 15 minutes out, and then Asheville's entire South Slope brewery district another 30 minutes beyond that. This is not a beer destination that requires any planning to access. It's just part of being here.

          <h2>Breweries Right in Waynesville</h2>

          <h3>Panacea Brewing Company</h3>

          <p>Panacea is the one we send guests to first. It's right on the main drag in downtown Waynesville, the taproom has a good indoor/outdoor setup, and the beer is consistently solid across a range of styles. They do a good job with lagers and lighter ales, which isn't always the case at craft breweries that sometimes over-focus on the extreme end of the spectrum. If you want something approachable and clean, Panacea is reliable.</p>

          <p>The food menu is simple and good, the kind of tavern food that works well with a flight or two. On weekend evenings they often have live music, which gives the place a nice energy without getting too loud. The walk from downtown Waynesville's restaurant row to Panacea is five minutes, so a dinner-then-brewery evening is very easy to put together from Mojo Manor.</p>

          <h3>Boojum Brewing</h3>

          <p>Boojum Brewing has been around since 2013 and is one of the more established craft breweries in the immediate Waynesville area. Their hop-forward IPAs have a following, and they regularly rotate in seasonal and specialty releases that are worth trying if you're visiting multiple times. The taproom atmosphere is relaxed and the staff knows the beer well enough to help you navigate the tap list if you're not sure what you want.</p>

          <p>Boojum is a short drive from Mojo Manor, which makes it an easy add-on to a day that starts in Waynesville. They don't have a full food kitchen, so plan to eat before or after rather than there.</p>

          <h2>Nearby: Canton and the Surrounding Area</h2>

          <h3>BearWaters Brewing Company</h3>

          <p>BearWaters is in Canton, about 15 minutes west of Waynesville on US-19. Canton is a working mill town that doesn't get much tourism attention, which means BearWaters has developed a genuinely local clientele rather than catering primarily to visitors. The result is a brewery that feels real. The beer quality is high, particularly their wheat ales and darker seasonal offerings, and the taproom has a good back porch setup for warm weather.</p>

          <p>The surrounding town of Canton is worth a few minutes of driving around too. It's the kind of small mountain town that's been there since before the tourism industry arrived, and the main street still has the bones of a real community rather than a tourist strip. Stop at the bakery or the local diner if you're there in the morning.</p>

          <h2>30-Minute Drive: Asheville's South Slope</h2>

          <p>If you're making a dedicated brewery day, Asheville's South Slope neighborhood is the destination. It's a six-to-eight block area just south of downtown Asheville that has the highest density of craft breweries we've seen anywhere outside of a couple of major cities. You can walk between them, which is the point.</p>

          <p>The ones worth knowing:</p>

          <p><strong>Wicked Weed Brewing</strong> on Biltmore Avenue was one of the originals that helped put Asheville on the craft beer map. They're particularly known for sour and funky ales, and the barrel room they operate is impressive. The main taproom has a large outdoor patio and serves full food.</p>

          <p><strong>Hi-Wire Brewing</strong> has a massive taproom space on the South Slope that works well for groups. Their core lager is genuinely excellent, one of the better craft lagers we've had anywhere, and they rotate through a wide range of styles. Good for people who don't usually love craft beer because the lager is approachable and clean.</p>

          <p><strong>Catawba Brewing</strong> has a large Asheville location with a good tap list and a space that accommodates larger groups comfortably. Originally from Morganton, they've been in Asheville long enough to feel like a local institution. The outdoor area along the South Slope's main strip is good for people-watching while you drink.</p>

          <p><strong>Burial Beer Co.</strong> is worth seeking out if you want something a little more adventurous. They specialize in mixed fermentation and unconventional ingredients, and the results are consistently interesting. Not everyone's style, but if you're into that end of craft brewing, this is a standout.</p>

          <h2>A Brewery Day Itinerary from Mojo Manor</h2>

          <p>The easiest version of a brewery day from Waynesville looks something like this. Start with lunch and a couple pints at Panacea in downtown Waynesville. Mid-afternoon, drive to Asheville (30 minutes) and park near the South Slope. Walk Hi-Wire, Wicked Weed, and Catawba over two to three hours. Have dinner somewhere on the South Slope or nearby downtown Asheville. Drive back to Waynesville, which takes 30 minutes on I-40 and is a completely reasonable drive if you've been responsible about your pint count.</p>

          <p>The key is having a designated driver or rotating that responsibility through the group. An Uber from Asheville back to Waynesville is also available but not cheap at that distance. Plan ahead on that one.</p>

Mojo Manor has a game room and hot tub for the post-brewery wind-down. 10 guests, 4 bedrooms, 5 minutes from downtown Waynesville.</p>
